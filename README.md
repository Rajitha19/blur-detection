# blur-detection
The blur-detection project is a Python library for detecting blur in images. It uses the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to decompose an image into its frequency components, and then uses a threshold to determine whether the image is blurry. The project also includes a GUI that allows users to select an image and view the results of the blur detection algorithm.

The blur-detection project is based on the following papers:

"Blur Detection Based on the Fast Fourier Transform" by Jishnu S. Keerthi and Narendra Ahuja
"A Fast and Robust Method for Blur Detection" by David Lowe
The project is licensed under the MIT License.
